    <h2>Main Dish that is locally-served in Filipino Homes</h2>
    <p>A unique oxtail stew that is paired with peanut butter and beans.</p>
    <p>It is a mixture of sweetness and saltiness, with the creamy texture of the soup and finally the combined taste of beef and vegies that adds a punch.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pounds beef oxtail, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 large onion, quartered</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 large eggplant, cut into 2-inch chunks</li>
        <li>½ head bok choy, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>½ pound fresh green beans, trimmed and snapped into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>¼ cup peanut butter, or as needed to thicken sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large saucepan with water; add oxtail, onion, garlic, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, and simmer for 2 hours over medium-low heat, skimming off the foam occasionally, until oxtail meat is very tender and broth is reduced to 3 cups.</li>
        <li>Stir in eggplant, bok choy, and green beans; simmer for about 20 minutes, until vegetables are tender.</li>
        <li>Just before serving, place peanut butter in a small bowl and thin with 1 or 2 tablespoons of broth. Stir until smooth and add to stew.</li>
    </ol>
